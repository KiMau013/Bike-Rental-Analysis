# Bike Rental Analysis

This is an exercise in utilizing Python's various machine learning and data analytics libraries (Pandas, NumPy, ScikitLearn, Seaborn, etc.).

This was an attempt to utilize Jupyter Notebooks to create a workflow of assessing a large collection of data from a Bike Rental company (Capital).  The data is too large to include here, but assessed over 3.39 million data points.  After cleaning and extrapolating extra data from it, a series of visual descriptive output was created.  A (failed) Linear Regression was implemented to try and gain some insight into the correlation within the data points.

Due to the nature of dealing with sugh a large dataset for this project, a second Jupyter Notebook was created that housed purely the output and visual aspects(BikeRentals_Dashboard.ipynb).  It looks similar to the main one, minus all the data and testing.  For the sake of sharing the results, the main notebook was pre-run and output images to include in the dashboard.

This is an exercise in utilizing Python's various machine learning and data analytics libraries (Pandas, NumPy, ScikitLearn, Seaborn, etc.).  3.9.5

This was an attempt to utilize Jupyter Notebooks to create a workflow of assessing a large collection of data from a Bike Rental company (Capital).  The data is too large to include here, but assessed over 3.39 million data points.  After cleaning and extrapolating extra data from it, a series of visual descriptive output was created.  A (failed) Linear Regression was implemented to try and gain some insight into the correlation within the data points.

Due to the nature of dealing with sugh a large dataset for this project, a second Jupyter Notebook was created that housed purely the output and visual aspects(BikeRentals_Dashboard.ipynb).  It looks similar to the main one, minus all the data and testing.  For the sake of sharing the results, the main notebook was was pre-run and output images to include in the dashboard.
